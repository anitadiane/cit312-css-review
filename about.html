    <p >Hi, my name is Anita Studer. I am a student at IUPUI pursuing a bachelor's in CIT:
        Web Development and minoring in Chinese Studies. I am 23 years old. <br>I was born in the Philippines but raised
        in the US for almost 20 years now. I am currently employed at IUPUI with UITS TCC as a consultant supervisor.<br>
    Upon graduation, I plan to travel and work abroad incorporating both web development and Chinese into a career. Thank you.</p>
